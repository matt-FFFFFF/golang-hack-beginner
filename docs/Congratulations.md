## Bonus content

If you are really stuck for something to do, or you want to take this forward, then why not try the following:

* Implement API paging, limit the max output size and include in the results a link to the next 'page'
* Change the backend for MongoDB - this can be on Azure (CosmodDB) or locally using the Docker image
