# Welcome!

First and foremost, welcome to the Golang hack! We are excited for you to join us, whether you're a n00b or an experience Golang developer.  In this hack we are offering a few different tracks for you to choose from that will help you learn Golang no matter your level of expertise (or none at all).  

This hack was devised from an idea from April Edwards and Matt White.  We were both learning Golang and wanted to find others that wanted to learn.  We wrote this hack to bring us GOphers together and collate learning materials and resources for everyone.

This hack was designed to run over 2 days.  The aim is to provide learning materials, a learning path and a sense of community with your team (and the wider community).  Your teams have been divided up by skill set.

Skill levels:
 Level Zero: n00b, never coded with Golang but are super eager to learn
 Level 100: have dabbled in Golang, maybe 'Hello World' or something simple
 Level 200: Some coding in Golang, looking for your next learning challenge or a real-life example
 Level 300 - 400: Very experienced, or expert level. Still hoping to learn a bit more.

We asked each person to register and provide their approximate skill set. Thus, we have created a sort of 'create your own adventure' style of learning.  From  your teams you will be with like leveled individuals so that hopefully everyone is at a similar starting point in their learning journey.  It is suggested that you work together as a team, whether it be as a whole team, pair programming or asynchronously.  It is entirely up to your team.  It is important to setup some form of repo for the team and a Microsoft Teams site to communicate (unless one has already been provided).



# Pre-requisites

Before the start of the hack, it is highly recommended to review the pre-req's below.  Please make sure you have your machine setup before the hack begins.

We ask that everyone participating in the hack to have completed the Golang tour: https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1]



## Pre-requisites
1. Golang tour
2. setup machine

First things first, let's get your environment set up.

### Online Accounts

You will need a GitHub account for this, please ensure you have one. One member of your team will fork the repo and invite the others as collaborators.

### Software Installation

Download and install this software onto your Windows machine.
Accept the defaults unless mentioned.

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   * Ensure the default editor is Visual Studio Code

3. [Go for Windows](https://golang.org/dl/)
4. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
5. [Docker for Windows](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)
6. [Windows Terminal](ms-windows-store://pdp?productId=9N0DX20HK701) (recommended)

First press ```CTRL+p``` to enter *quick open*.
Then type:

```ext install ms-vscode.go```

Repeat this process and install:

# Getting Started in Your Team

Once in your team, discuss which path of the hack you would like to explore as a group.  We have outlined some suggestions to help you understand what each path entails:

Suggested path per skill level:
 Level Zero - 100: Day 1, it is worth reviewing the Go tour with your team and make sure everyone is comfortable with the concepts. This is a great time to review with the team the topics learned and make sure there aren't any questions.  
Next phase: once completed the review of the Go Tour, we highly recommend going through the next level of exercises, learning loops and arrays.  You may choose to proceed to Book API Challenge 1 if your group desires.

Level 200: Your group can choose to complete the learning tutorials on loops and arrays before proceeding to the Book API (Challenge 1).  This is recommended to decide on with your group.  Else, you can proceed straight to Challenge 1. **LINK**

Level 300 - 400: There is an assumption that you're very familiar with the concepts in the Go tour.  You will go straight to (Need challenge name and link*****). You may also choose to complete the Book API path as a warmup before proceeding to the main challenge, it is comprised of 4 challenges

## Next Steps

You now have a choice. You can start with a couple of warm up exercises in [ground zero](GroundZero.md)...

Or, you can get start the hack with [hello world](helloworld.md)
