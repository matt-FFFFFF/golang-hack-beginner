# Bookdata-api Challenge 1

## Background

Your team has inherited the a rudimentary book data API and is now responsible for its maintenance.

Your first task is one of familiarity, get to know the code and understand how it works.

## Dev Container

You'll notice that VScode has been configured to use a dev container.
This is a way of codifying & standardising the development and (hopefully) the CI/CD toolchain as well. If prompted, open the repo in the dev container. It will take a few minutes to build the container at first, but should then contain all the tools you will need going forward.

## Fork it

The source repo is here:
<https://github.com/matt-FFFFFF/bookdata-api>, one team member should fork the repo and invite the rest of the team as collaborators.

Consider how you will each work on the code and how you will manage co-editing.

## Task

Your task is to demonstrate understanding of the code.

## Success criteria

* You can explain to your coach how the code works
* You can compile and run the code using ```go build```
* You can use Postman to query your API
* You can successfully debug the code and set a breakpoint in VS code

Next, let's look at the [bookdata-api challenge 2](bookdata-02.md)
