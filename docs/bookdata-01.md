# Bookdata-api Challenge 1

## Background

Your team has the following PoC API and is now responsible for its maintenance.

Your first task is one of familiarity, get to know the code and understand how it works.

## Dev Container

You'll notice that VScode has been configured to use a dev container.
This is a way of codifying & standardising the development and (hopefully) the CI/CD toolchain as well. If prompted, open the repo in the dev container. It will take a few minutes to build the container at first, but should then contain all the tools you will need going forward.

## Examining the code

You will be sent a link to the code, one team member must fork the repo and invite the rest of your team as collaborators.

## Task

Your task is to demonstrate understanding of the code.

## Success criteria

* You can explain to your coach how the code works
* You can compile and run the code using ```go build```
* You can use Postman to query your API
* You can successfully debug the code and set a breakpoint in VS code
