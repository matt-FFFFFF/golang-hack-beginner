# Beginner Track

Welcome to the Golang hack!  This is the beginner's track.  We hope that everyone is ready to learn!

We have asked everyone to complete the go tour before starting the first challenge.  If you have yet to finish the Tour of Go, don't fret you can complete it here:  https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1 
More importantly if you're comfortable with the concepts then you're ready to proceed.

For n00bs, we have 2 learning tasks that you can complete on day 1 of the hack.  We've chosen some fun tasks to help you learn.  You can complete this as a team or paired up with someone to a similar skill set.  This hack is all about learning and community, so get hacking!

For the next two exercises you will need to create an Exercism account: https://exercism.io/   

When we setup this hack we fond lots of people could get to 'hello world!' then were not sure where to go.  So we've setup 2 exercises that you will allow you to learn some fundamentals before Challenge 1 (What you learn in these learning modules are not required, but cover off some learning that we think will benefit you in the long term).  These modules are NOT mandatory, if you feel your team understands the concepts outline below, please review each module and confirm with a coach that you're comfortable with the skills to move onto Challenge 1 

## Learning Module 1: Scrabble Score - Learning Loops

Learning loops is a key skill with learning almost any programming language.  The exercise that we have chosen covers off loops, strings and maps.  If you are comfortable with how loops work, you can skip to learning module 2.

1. Once you're logged into Exercism, go to 'Scrabble Score' in the Go track: https://exercism.io/my/solutions/b8efbe40f7b34a62bfcefd3652c254e9

2. Exercism will provide you a step by step walk through, as well as the ability to run the exercise locally on your machine.  We would suggest you download the exercises with their download link provided: 

        exercism download --exercise=scrabble-score --track=go

3. Start learning!

4. Once you've completed the learning module, submit your solution:

        exercism submit /path/to/file [/path/to/file2 ...]

5. Exercism will find a mentor to give you feedback on your solution, this could take 15 minutes, or a day (depends on availability). Your solution may require a few touch ups, that's okay :)  While we're working in a hack, we realize a solution may not come as quickly as we would like.  Copy your solution and submit to a coach as well as the Exercism mentoring system.  You are welcome to submit a solution as a team, a pair, or as an individual.  

    a. Submitting to a coach: please bear with us as this is trial and error, send a link of your solution to a coach with the names of the hackers who have written the code.  For those working in timezones out of BST (i.e. US, Asia, etc) there is a good chance a coach won't be online at the time.  Please send it over, we will check it when online.

6. Once you have submitted your solution, please move onto learning module 2, you do not need to wait on a response to your solution

## Learning Module 2: Proverb - Learning Arrays

Onto learning arrays!  Hopefully you found Learning Module 2 fun and enjoyable?

Next up, we're going to focus on learning arrays, another common programming language task.  For this task we have chosen the 'Proverb' tasks.  Again, if you feel that you are comfortable with arrays, please proceed to the next task.


Learning loops is a key skill with learning almost any programming language.  The exercise that we have chosen covers off loops, strings and maps.  If you are comfortable with how loops work, you can skip to learning module 2.

1. Log into into Exercism, go to 'Proverb': https://exercism.io/my/solutions/1cf0d259aae44496a624a8ed078364eb

2. Similar to Learning Module 1, download the task:

        exercism download --exercise=proverb --track=go

3. Complete the task in your teams, pair, or individually if you prefer.  Submit your code to Exercism: 

        exercism submit /path/to/file [/path/to/file2 ...]

4. Please share your solution with a coach

# Challenge 1

Congratulations !  You've completed the first 2 learning modules! There is a lot to learn in a new programming language, learning things like 'hello world' can get a bit dull.  We hope that you enjoyed the modules.  We would love feedback on them at the end of the hack.

To progress and begin the challenge, please start at [Hello World](docs\helloworld.md)

You will be given all of the directions, and tools you need!  Good luck!
